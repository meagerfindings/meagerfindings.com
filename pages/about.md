## Meager what now?

For ten years I have been coming back to this name, wanting to do something with it. I first thought of this name when naming my photography business while in college. I love capturing the small details of things, the small moments, or the often missed oddities in spaces around us.

## Meager Beginnings

We are not rich, but we are blessed. We are not geniuses but we are diligent and determined. Thankfully, our parents have taught us many things and set us forward on paths so that we are not starting out from a place of massive debt. When we first got married, Kate and I both worked as baristas at Starbucks and for the first several years, remained baristas. Kate became a social worker while still in Chicago and I worked at a more prestigious coffee shop in Chicago.

It was during these first years of marriage where we learned to shop at Aldi's and let the city provide us with entertainment for free. We didn't seek to be frugal, we simply had to be frugal. We didn't really know what we were doing with finances, but we were making it through each month, yet still living full and fulfilling lives.

Four years ago we moved to Colorado to be closer to family and through God's provision Kate is still a case worker and I am now working in tech support and growing into a software engineer.

## Meager Steps

We don't have quick, get rich now ideas for you, but we are recording the steps we take as we reach to live lives full of value while reaching towards financial independence. Some of the steps are easy and anyone can implement them. Some of them will be a little harder and only applicable in some situations. However, each of them are step, rather than a sacrifice.
