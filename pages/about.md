For ten years I have been coming back to this name, wanting to do something with it. I first thought of this name when naming my photography business while in college. I love capturing the small details of things, the small moments, or the often missed oddities in spaces around us.

For more on the name, check out my post: [Meager what now?](/meager-what-now/)

## Meager Beginnings

We are not rich, but we are blessed. We are not geniuses but we are diligent and determined. Thankfully, our parents have taught us many things and set us forward on paths so that we are not starting out from a place of massive debt. When we first got married, Kate and I both worked as baristas at Starbucks and for the first several years, remained baristas. Kate became a social worker while still in Chicago and I worked at a more prestigious coffee shop in Chicago.

It was during these first years of marriage where we learned to shop at Aldi's and let the city provide us with entertainment for free. We didn't seek to be frugal, we simply had to be frugal. We didn't really know what we were doing with finances, but we were making it through each month, yet still living full and fulfilling lives.

Four years ago we moved to Colorado to be closer to family and through God's provision Kate is still a case worker and I am now working in tech support and growing into a software engineer.

## Meager Steps

We don't have quick, get rich now ideas for you, but we are recording the steps we take as we reach to live lives full of value while reaching towards financial independence. Some of the steps are easy and anyone can implement them. Some of them will be a little harder and only applicable in some situations. However, each of them are step, rather than a sacrifice.

## Meager Goals

After years of just living and trying to do what I thought was right, we stumbled on the concept of FI. Turns out, weâ€™ve been living some of these principles out for some time now. Sometimes out of necessity, sometimes it was just the next logical, moral choice for us. Now that we've been introduced to FI, we're being more intentional with a much more specific purpose.

Some of the things discussed will be completely obvious to you, if so great! Some of them have been to us as well, however in conversations with friends I've realized not everyone has the same thoughts about money, adventure, and actually getting value in every day situations.

Maybe we'll spark a thought that helps broach a topic with your spouse or loved one that can change someones trajectory in life. Honestly though, our goal is much smaller, document the things we're doing now, our goals, and aspirations. Maybe we'll provide a conversation starter for someone. Or perhaps we'll simply look back on these posts in the future like we look back at our fashion choices from years ago and just laugh.

Either way, we hope you enjoy this adventure and find some sort of value in our meagerfindings.
