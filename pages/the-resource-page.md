## Banking Resources

### [Marcus](https://www.marcus.com/us/en)

We currently keep our savings for our downpayment in an online savings account at [Marcus by Goldman Sachs](https://www.marcus.com/us/en). There is no minimum deposit, no monthly minimum, and no transaction fees.

**Best Feature:** They currently offer one of the best annual rates of return at 1.8% (as of 08/08/2018), [compare this to rate to that of a sign up bonus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-07-13-earning-900-in-less-than-4-hours.md %}#enter-the-sign-up-bonuses). Their rates have increased to 0.3% in the last 5 months, not to shabby.

_Quick tip if you sign up for Marcus… their website will not allow you to sign in if you are using a VPN._

### [Capital One 360](https://www.capitalone.com/bank/savings-accounts/online-savings-account/)

I've been using this online savings account back since it was ING Direct and had an annual return rate of 3%, boy have things changed since then. The account has changed names a few times and is currently [Capital One 360 Savings](https://www.capitalone.com/bank/savings-accounts/online-savings-account/). The current savings rate is 1%, there are no fees, and there is no minimum balance.

**Best Feature:** Ability to open multiple accounts within the account. This is a great digital way to follow [Dave-Ramsey's Envelop System](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/envelope-system-explained). While we don't follow this system, we do have a few sub-accounts setup:
  - Car Insurance Fund
  - Registration/License Fund
  - Etc...

We use these sub-accounts as "envelopes" for our known big-expenditures and automatically deposit monthly into this account. You can name the accounts appropriately and then you have a very easy time seeing where your money is allocated. Prior to Marcus and M1, we stored our Emergency Fund in one of these envelopes.

### Book Resources

#### Your Local Library

Endless amounts of books, cds, audiobooks, blu-rays, dvds, and magazines. Between our library's physical and online resources, I read/listened to 72 books for free in one year. Let's say that was 36 new books at $20 a pop and 36 audiobooks at $25 a book...

```
books = 36 * $20 = $720
audiobooks = 36 * $25 = $900

books + audiobooks = $1,620 saved in one year
```

_Granted you could get those book used, or cheaper but the library still provided all that value for free._

You might be surprised, your library may even carry some FI focused books. Ours carries a few copies of [Set for Life](https://amzn.to/2KHue65) by Scott Trench.

##### [Hoopla Digital](https://www.hoopladigital.com/)

Check with your local library, they may provide free electronic content on [Hoopla Digital](https://www.hoopladigital.com/). Hoopla offers movies, music, audiobooks, ebooks, comics and TV shows all from your phone, tablet or computer.

##### [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/)

Also through your local library. Browse, place holds on and checkout audiobooks and eBooks with [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/). A stronger audiobook app than Hoopla, tends to crash a lot less often on Android. Checkout the ebook on your phone through Overdrive and have it immediately delivered to your [Kindle](https://amzn.to/2KOOa7v).

My library locked down the request a book feature from the app, I may have abused this, but I can still fill out a form to request new digital content. It looks like each library customizes their settings for the app so you may still have the option to request new items directly from the app for your local library.

##### [Flipster Magazine app](https://flipster.ebsco.com/)

Another app that your local library may provide. [Flipster](https://flipster.ebsco.com/) allows you to browse and download various magazines. Our library in the middle of nowhere provides several backpacking, outdoor, and local Denver area magazines saving upwards of $24 a year per magazine if we were to subscribe to the magazine or much more if we were to buy them in the checkouts.


#### [The Simple Path to Wealth](https://amzn.to/2OX3FgE)

Pickup a copy of [The Simple Path to Wealth](https://amzn.to/2OX3FgE) by J.L. Collins for some solid thinking on keeping your investments simple, reasons to pursue FI, and why and how to invest in low fee, broad based index funds. J.L. Collins also makes this information freely [available on his website](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/) in a longer, online version.

## Investing Resources

### [M1 Finance](https://mbsy.co/mGmjq)

[M1 Finance](https://mbsy.co/mGmjq) allows you to setup "pies"  comprised of different funds, stocks, bonds. You can choose from their target allocation pies or create your own. You can even have sub-pies.

[M1](https://mbsy.co/mGmjq) allows you to purchase partial shares of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. This means that if you don't have enough money to invest into a particular fund, you can still invest into it partially.

Currently our emergency fund is within M1 for a few reasons:
1. This controversial and thought provoking [Choose FI interview](https://www.choosefi.com/066-the-emergency-fund/).
2. We have a stupid amount of money in a liquid state as we save up for a house down payment.

**Best feature:** Partial shares since this allows us to have less cash sitting, waiting to be invested.

Sign up with [my referral link](https://mbsy.co/mGmjq) and you'll get $10 to start investing with.

## Budgeting Tools

### [Mint](https://www.mint.com/)

One of the biggest things in controlling your finances is knowing where your money goes. Once you hook up [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) to the bank accounts you used to spend money you can automatically track all of your outgoing expenses. If you make any cash purchases you simply add those in using their easy to use interface.

I have nearly 10 years worth of expenses and income tracked in [Mint](https://www.mint.com/), as a result, it is a trivial task to see trends in where our money has been going and to also set realistic projections on what we will spend in the future.

This _free_ resource allows you to export all of your transactions in a `.csv` file. Over the last few years I have a spreadsheet with macros to import this file, parse out expenses, and display them in ways that allow me to interact with them at a deeper level. Someday I'll clean this up and simplify it for general consumption, maybe.

**Best Feature:** Set it and forget it. Once setup you can simply go about business as usual and then check in to see where your money has been going.

### [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/)

Like [Mint](#mint), Personal Capital helps you track your expenses and bank accounts. I mainly use [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/) to track our investment accounts as it keeps individual historical records of each account from the time you sync up to your banks and allows you to see an aggregate view of all of your accounts. This is net worth tracking made easy.

**Best feature:** Fee analyzer. Once your accounts are hooked up and importing data, you can click on _Planning_ and then _Retirement Fee Analyzer_ to analyze the fees you are paying on each account and see what the cumulative affect, projected over years will be. If you already know what these fees can do ++link to 1% article++, then these at least help you see all the of fees you are being charged in one place. You can filter the accounts as well in the projections.

## Shopping Tools

### [CamelCamelCamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/)

A delightfully odd name, that makes a little sense. Like a camel's humps, prices on Amazon.com go up and down over time. Pop an Amazon URL or keyword into [CamelCamelCamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/) to see historical prices for items on Amazon to make sure you're not buying at a possible peak.

**Best feature:** If you create an account on [CamelCamelCamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/), you can have the site track your public Amazon wishlists by entering in their public URLs. This allows you to get email notifications when items on your wishlists fall below a set price or percentage of difference from the normal price. You can set this up for oil and oil filters for your car and stock up when the price is at its lowest.

### [iBotta](https://ibotta.com/r/cbvrhqr)

My wife and I have earned $80+ through [iBotta](https://ibotta.com/r/cbvrhqr) over the last 2 years for only a few minutes of our time.

Claim offers, go shopping, scan your receipt with the app, and you'll earn credits to your account. Cash-out with PayPal or other services. Use my [referral code](https://ibotta.com/r/cbvrhqr) for a $10 start.

### [Fakespot](https://www.fakespot.com/)

Something have rave reviews on Amazon that seem to good to be true? Simply post an Amazon url into [Fakespot](https://www.fakespot.com/) to get a review of the reviews on the Amazon item's page and you'll get an analysis of the reviews to see if they have tell-tale markers of being fraudulent. A great last step in your Amazon checkout process.

### [Fetch](https://bit.ly/2HnQVuw)

Like [iBotta](#ibotta), [Fetch](https://bit.ly/2HnQVuw) allows you to turn your grocery receipts into rewards. I'm newer to this service and I have not cashed out yet. Fetch allows you to simply scan the receipt, no survey to fill out, no video to watch, no rebate to apply. Just scan your receipt and it credits you with points.

Enter my referral code, `GC4DW` at the sign-up screen and you'll get 2,000 Fetch Points ($2.00 in points!) when you complete one receipt.

### [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)

We use [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) to house our collaborative grocery list and weekly meal plans. Google recently updated the app on Android to suggest common grocery items in a grocery list as well and it does a decent job there.

## Technology Tools

### [1Password](https://1password.com/)

Password reuse is one of the easiest ways for nefarious folks to get into your accounts or steal your money. [1Password](https://1password.com/) enables you to securely generate, store, and access all of your passwords from any of your devices. I have been using their service for nearly 10 years and can't imagine navigating online banking, e-commerce sites, investment accounts, email, or any other site without this truly amazing tool. You can easily generate complex, and [more importantly, long](https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm)  passwords for each site you visit.

I was using this service back when you could just buy the desktop app, but the new monthly subscription fee is one of the few that I am willing to pay as it ensure that [1Password](https://1password.com/) will be staying around and continually receive security updates.

### Excel

Excel really is a no brainer due to it's market prominence and either the joy or frustration that it provides in nearly every workplace on a daily basis. You can use [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) if you do not want to pay for Microsoft Office's subscription. It is getting better but can get bogged down with large, complex spreadsheets. Granted you can do this all with pencil and paper, but seeing trends and forecasting are faster for me in Excel and frankly I wouldn't even try keeping our budget and balances on paper these days. Pair this with the csv export from [Mint](#mint) and you can even kinda automate your process using macros and formulas, but you [may overcomplicate things too...](https://xkcd.com/1319/)

[Office Libre](https://www.libreoffice.org/) provides an open-source, non-google, desktop alternative to Excel, however if Excel is your daily driver, the differences can be painful here, the same can be said of [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) as well.

### [Google Opinion Rewards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks)
_Only applicable for Android users._

Interested in receiving Google Play Store credit for completing short surveys based on recent purchases or places you have visited? If so, [Google Opinion Rewards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks) is the app for you. I have received $32 since September of last year, a smaller amount than my other friends using this app. The credits you earn can be used to for any purchase you make on the Google Play Store.

### [Tunnel Bear VPN](https://www.tunnelbear.com/)

[Tunnelbear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/) allows me to bank, research, and interact with the internet without putting on a tinfoil hat. This VPN provider is vetted by external third-parties, is easy to use, and works on every OS for both phones and computers. Using a VPN is a great way to help ensure your connection between your bank and your browser are secure.
