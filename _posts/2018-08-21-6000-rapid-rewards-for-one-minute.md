Remember when I discovered that [not all junk mail is junk mail]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-07-13-earning-900-in-less-than-4-hours.md %})? I have another example of a quick win for minimal effort, if you can even call it effort.

## 6,000 Southwest Rapid Rewards points for an Email Address

Southwest is giving out 6,000 Rapid Rewards points for 1 minute of your time and your consent to let them send you emails.

## Why are they doing this?

You may recall that right before June of this year, your inbox was suddenly flooded with new privacy policies and services asking your to allow them to email you. This was due to the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) becoming enforceable back on May, 25 2018, requiring companies [to gain your consent before continuing to send marketing emails to you](https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2018/02/10/dos-donts-sending-emails-gdpr/). Southwest may have wisely waited for the dust to settle before sending out their consent request or they may have needed to up the ante to get email consent again.

## $60 in a Minute?

Time is not a renewable resource, so I tend to break down task duration and cost down to hourly rates or down to the minute. [Nerd Wallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/reward-program-reviews/southwest-rapid-rewards-points/) currently values Southwest Rapid Rewards points between 0.9 cents per point and 1.6 cents per point, depending on the ways in which you redeem your points.

For the sake of simplicity, lets call it 1 cent per point:

```
6,000 points * $0.01 = $60.00
```

Taking the two required steps to qualify for this bonus took me literally less than one minute to complete. I'm tempted to call this post _"Getting a $3,600 an Hour Rate for One Minute"_ but I think that is a little to far on the side click-bait and sensationalism. Regardless, there's $60 for signing up for an email.

## The Fine Print

After reading the fine print on the mailer, there are a few things to keep in mind:
- You must open an email at least once every 60 days.
- You must stay opted in.
- You must keep your account open... _umm yeah_.

**This offer is only valid for the Rewards Member listed on the mailer.** This mailer is probably being sent out to all Rapid Rewards Members, but I am not 100% sure on this. However, I currently don't have any ideas on how to get $60 a minute for my time, so I'd willing to gamble one minute of my time and a few more promotional emails for the chance at snagging this bonus.
